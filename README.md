# First_Todo_List
To-do list application built with the intention of learning how to combine JS with HTML/CSS

Using only pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Uses local storage to keep track of your current tasks even if you close the tab or the whole browser.

Includes the ability to delete individual tasks, as well as edit them after creation. I did not separate completing a task from deleting it, so when it's completed, you would simply delete the task.
